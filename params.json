{"name":"Spandsp","tagline":"","body":"spandsp 0.0.5 - A DSP library for telephony\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSpanDSP is a library of DSP functions for telephony, in the 8000 sample per\r\nsecond world of E1s, T1s, and higher order PCM channels. It contains low level\r\nfunctions, such as basic filters. It also contains higher level functions, such\r\nas cadenced supervisory tone detection, and a complete software FAX machine.\r\nThe software has been designed to avoid intellectual property issues, using\r\nmature techniques where all relevant patents have expired. See the file\r\nDueDiligence for important information about these intellectual property issues.\r\n\r\nThe library is licenced under the LGPL 2.1 licence. The test suite, and some support\r\nprograms are licenced under the GPL 2 licence. The full text of these licences can\r\nbe found in the file COPYING.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nspandsp depends on various other packages for various tasks. Most of these\r\ndependencies relate to building the test suite.\r\n\r\nlibtiff (and libtiff-devel on most Linux distributions) is required to\r\nbuild the spandsp library.\r\n\r\nlibaudiofile (and libaudiofile-devel) is required to build the test suite\r\nfftw (and fftw-devel) is required to build the test suite. Version 2 or 3 of\r\nFFTW may be used. Spandsp adapts to the differences between them.\r\n\r\nfltk (and fltk-devel), Fl_Cartesian and Fl_Audio_Meter are required to build\r\nthe test suite with GUI interfaces for some of the tests. The tests will build\r\nwithout these packages, but the GUI features will not be available.\r\nFl_Cartesian and Fl_Audio_Meter can be downloaded from\r\nhttp://www.soft-switch.org/downloads.\r\n\r\nSteve Underwood <steveu@coppice.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
